# Print notes

The blender STL exporter does some funky unit conversion which causes cura to load everything at 10% of its size. All of these models need to be scaled up to 1000% after importing to cura.

The exception to this is the nuke, it looks stupid at 1000% so i've been using 750% instead.

All tiny models are printed at 0.1mm layer height, the bases are 0.2mm as they have no detail.

UFOs and carriers require some gluing after being printed, its pretty obvious how they go together.
